At a very coarse level, ML works as follows. \n","\n","First, you come up somehow with a very complicated model $\\hat{y} = M(x, \\theta)$, which computes an output $\\hat{y}$ as a function of an input $x$ and of a vector of parameters $\\theta$.   In general, $x$, $y$, and $\\theta$ are vectors, as the model has multiple inputs, multiple outputs, and several parameters.  The model $M$ needs to be complicated, because only complicated models can represent complicated phenomena; for instance, $M$ can be a multi-layer neural net with parameters $\\theta = [\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_k]$, where $k$ is the number of parameters of the model. \n","\n","Second, you come up with a notion of _loss_ $L$, that is, how badly the model is doing.  For instance, if you have a list of inputs $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$, and a set of desired outputs $y_1, \\ldots, y_m$, you can use as loss: \n","\n","$$\n","L(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\!|y_i - \\hat{y}_i |\\!| = \\sum_{i=1}^n |\\!| y_i - M({x}_i, \\theta)|\\!| \\; .\n","$$\n","\n","Here, we wrote $L(\\theta)$ because, once the inputs $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and the desired outputs $y_1, \\ldots, y_n$ are chosen, the loss $L$ depends only on $\\theta$. \n","\n","Once the loss is chosen, you decrease it, by computing its _gradient_ with respect to ${\\theta}$.  Remembering that ${\\theta} = [\\theta_1, \\ldots, \\theta_k]$,\n","\n","$$\n","\\nabla_{\\theta} L = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_1}, \\ldots, \n","    \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\theta_k} \\right] \\; .\n","$$\n","\n","The gradient is a vector that indicates how to tweak ${\\theta}$ to decrease the loss.  You then choose a small _step size_ $\\delta$, and you update ${\\theta}$ via ${\\theta} := {\\theta} - \\delta \\nabla_{\\theta} L$.  This makes the loss a little bit smaller, and the model a little bit better.  If you repeat this step many times, the model will hopefully get (a good bit) better. \n","\n","## Autogradient\n","\n","The key to _pleasant_ ML is to focus on building the model $M$ in a way that is sufficiently expressive, and on choosing a loss $L$ that is helpful in guiding the optimization.  The computation of the gradient is done automatically for you.  This capability, called _autogradient_, is implemented in ML frameworks such as [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.com), [Keras](https://keras.io), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).  \n","\n","It is possible to use these advanced ML libraries without ever knowing what is under the hood, and how autogradient works.  Here, we will insted dive in, and implement autogradient.  \n","\n","Building a model $M$ corresponds to building an expression with inputs ${x}$, ${\\theta}$.  We will provide a representaton for expressions that enables both the calculation of the expression value, and the differentiation with respect to any of the inputs.  This will enable us to implement autogradient.  On the basis of this, we will be able to implement a simple ML framework. \n","\n","We say we, but we mean you.  _You_ will implement it; we will just provide guidance."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"deletable":false,"editable":false,"nbgrader":{"cell_type":"markdown","checksum":"c511030c427fcc881acb582a0a792308","grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-e9bccc09404dd2b0","locked":true,"schema_version":3,"solution":false},"id":"dVeMJm26P4j-"},"source":["## Overview\n","\n","Let us give you a preview of how our ML framework works with an example. \n","\n","Assume for simplicity that our ML problem has only one input $x$, and one output $y$.  We are given many pairs $x_1, y_1, \\ldots, x_n, y_n$ of training input/output pairs, and we want to approximate the input-output relation via a parabola, whose coefficient we need to determine.  In particular, the predicted $\\hat{y}$ is given by: \n","\n","$$\n","\\hat{y} = a x^2 + bx + c\n","$$\n","\n","and the coefficients of the model $M$ are ${\\theta} = [a, b, c]$.

In the limit where the step size goes to 0, and the number of steps to infinity, you are guaranteed (if the function is differentiable, and some other hypotheses) converge to the minimum; the problem is that it would take infinitely long.

It is true; Pytorch does add a few things:\n","\n","* Ability to deal with $n$-dimensional tensors, to represent vectors of inputs and outputs. \n","* Optimized backends, using both parallelism and GPUs. \n","* Sophisticated mechanisms to deal with large datasets.\n","* A wide array of operations available on tensors, of which autograd can be computed. \n","* Many implemented heuristics to deal with step size.\n","* Implemented neural layers (sigmoids, ReLU, etc).\n","* Convolutional nets for images.\n","* Recurrent nets and LSTMs of streams of data.\n","\n","And more! But [aside from tensors, backends, GPUs, parallelism, operations, heuristics, neural layers including convolutions and LSTMs, and good output](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7tvauOJMHo), PyTorch is really nothing more than what you have already implemented."]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":[],"name":"Homework_11_test.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"},"test_info":{"id":"414c16f879d0f7f6b7f7e26c57de32df18cd90f4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
